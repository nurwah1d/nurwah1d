### 🧠 About Me

I'm an experienced **RPA Developer** designing and delivering automation solutions in the **Finance** and **Retail** sectors. I specialize in building robust, scalable bots using **UiPath**, and I thrive on solving complex business challenges through end-to-end process automation.

My expertise spans across:
- **Process Discovery & Automation Design**
- **UiPath Studio (Advanced Sequences, REFramework, Error Handling)**
- **Integration with APIs, SAP, SQL, Excel, Outlook, PDFs, and legacy desktop applications**
- **Document Understanding (OCR, ABBYY, Google Vision)**
- **Orchestrator Management (Queues, Assets, Schedules)**
- **CI/CD with Git & Azure DevOps**

I'm passionate about clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in version control, logging, and security (e.g., credential management via Orchestrator).
